There are 2 files that are part of this system.
* mailman_import.py
* drush_mailman.php

The mailman_import.py script needs to be placed in the sites/default/files directory of your Drupal installation.

The drush_mailman.php script needs to be placed in the sites/default directory of your Drupal installation.

Implementation
---

Create a Content Type that has Title and Body. I named mine listserve.

You will want to update the drush_mailman.php script so that it points to the content type ( if you don't use the 'listserve' name ) that you are going to save all the mailman scripts into.

setup a cron job to run an rsync command to pull the archives across.
